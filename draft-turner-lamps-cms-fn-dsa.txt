1.  Introduction

   The Fast-Fourier Transform over NTRU-Lattice-Based Digital Signature
   Algorithm (FN-DSA) is a digital signature algorithm standardised by
   the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as part
   of their post-quantum cryptography standardisation process.  It is
   intended to be secure against both "traditional" cryptographic
   attacks, as well as attacks utilising a quantum computer.  It offers
   smaller signatures and significantly faster runtimes than SLH-DSA
   [FIPS205], an alternative post-quantum signature algorithm also
   standardised by NIST.  This document specifies the use of the FN-DSA
   in the CMS at two security levels: FN-DSA-512 and FN-DSA-1024.  See
   Appendix B of I-D.turner-lamps-fn-dsa-certificates for more
   information on the security levels and key sizes of FN-DSA.

   Prior to standardisation, FN-DSA was known as Falcon.  FN-DSA and
   Falcon are not compatible.

   For each of the FN-DSA parameter sets, an algorithm identifier Object
   Identifier (OID) has been specified.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  FN-DSA Algorithm Identifiers

   Many ASN.1 data structure types use the AlgorithmIdentifier type to
   identify cryptographic algorithms.  In the CMS, the
   AlgorithmIdentifier field is used to identify FN-DSA signatures in
   the signed-data content type.  They may also appear in X.509
   certificates used to verify those signatures.  The same
   AlgorithmIdentifier values are used to identify FN-DSA public keys
   and signature algorithms.  I-D.turner-lamps-fn-dsa-certificates
   describes the use of FN-DSA in X.509 certificates.  The
   AlgorithmIdentifier type is defined as follows:

   AlgorithmIdentifier{ALGORITHM-TYPE, ALGORITHM-TYPE:AlgorithmSet} ::=
           SEQUENCE {
               algorithm   ALGORITHM-TYPE.&id({AlgorithmSet}),
               parameters  ALGORITHM-TYPE.
                      &Params({AlgorithmSet}{@algorithm}) OPTIONAL
           }

      |  NOTE: The above syntax is from [RFC5911] and is compatible with
      |  the 2021 ASN.1 syntax [X680].  See [RFC5280] for the 1988 ASN.1
      |  syntax.

   The fields in the AlgorithmIdentifier type have the following
   meanings:

   algorithm:  The algorithm field contains an OID that identifies the
      cryptographic algorithm in use.  The OIDs for FN-DSA are described
      below.

   parameters:  The parameters field contains parameter information for
      the algorithm identified by the OID in the algorithm field.  Each
      FN-DSA parameter set is identified by its own algorithm OID, so
      there is no relevant information to include in this field.  As
      such, parameters MUST be omitted when encoding an FN-DSA
      AlgorithmIdentifier.

   The OIDs for FN-DSA are defined in the NIST Computer Security Objects
   Register [CSOR], and are reproduced here for convenience.

   sigAlgs OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16)
       us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3) nistAlgorithms(4) 3 }

   id-fn-dsa-512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { sigAlgs TBD }

   id-fn-dsa-87 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { sigAlgs TBD }

3.  Signed-Data Conventions

3.1.  Pure Mode vs Pre-hash Mode

   [RFC5652] specifies that digital signatures for CMS are produced
   using a digest of the message to be signed and the signer's private
   key.  At the time of publication of that RFC, all signature
   algorithms supported in the CMS required a message digest to be
   calculated externally to that algorithm, which would then be supplied
   to the algorithm implementation when calculating and verifying
   signatures.  Since then, EdDSA [RFC8032], ML-DSA [FIPS20], and SLH-
   DSA [FIPS205], have also been standardised, and these algorithms
   support both a "pure" and "pre-hash" mode.  In the pre-hash mode, a
   message digest (the "pre-hash") is calculated separately and supplied
   to the signature algorithm as described above.  In the pure mode, the
   message to be signed or verified is instead supplied directly to the
   signature algorithm.  When EdDSA [RFC8419], SLH-DSA [RFC9814], and
   ML-DSA [RFC9882] are used with CMS, only the pure mode of those
   algorithms is specified.  This is because in most situations, CMS
   signatures are computed over a set of signed attributes that contain
   a hash of the content, rather than being computed over the message
   content itself.  Since signed attributes are typically small, use of
   pre-hash modes in the CMS would not significantly reduce the size of
   the data to be signed, and hence offers no benefit.  This document
   follows that convention and does not specify the use of FL-DSA's pre-
   hash mode ("HashFN-DSA") in the CMS.

3.2.  Signature Generation and Verification

   [RFC5652] describes the two methods that are used to calculate and
   verify signatures in the CMS.  One method is used when signed
   attributes are present in the signedAttrs field of the relevant
   SignerInfo, and another is used when signed attributes are absent.
   Each method produce a different "message digest" to be supplied to
   the signature algorithm in question, but because the pure mode of FN-
   DSA is used, the "message digest" is in fact the entire message.  Use
   of signed attributes is preferred, but the conventions for signed-
   data without signed attributes is also described below for
   completeness.

   When signed attributes are absent, FN-DSA (pure mode) signatures are
   computed over the content of the signed-data.  As described in
   Section 5.4 of [RFC5652], the "content" of a signed-data is the value
   of the encapContentInfo eContent OCTET STRING.  The tag and length
   octets are not included.

   When signed attributes are included, FN-DSA (pure mode) signatures
   are computed over the complete DER [X690] encoding of the SignedAttrs
   value contained in the SignerInfo's signedAttrs field.  As described
   in Section 5.4 of [RFC5652], this encoding includes the tag and
   length octets, but an EXPLICIT SET OF tag is used rather than the
   IMPLICIT \[0\] tag that appears in the final message.  At a minimum,
   the signedAttrs field MUST at minimum include a content-type
   attribute and a message-digest attribute.  The message-digest
   attribute contains a hash of the content of the signed-data, where
   the content is as described for the absent signed attributes case
   above.  Recalculation of the hash value by the recipient is an
   important step in signature verification.

   Section 4 of [RFC9814] describes how, when the content of a signed-
   data is large, performance may be improved by including signed
   attributes.  This is as true for FN-DSA as it is for SLH-DSA,
   although FN-DSA signature generation and verification is
   significantly faster than SLH-DSA.

   FN-DSA has a context string input that can be used to ensure that
   different signatures are generated for different application
   contexts.  When using FN-DSA as specified in this document, the
   context string is set to the empty string.

3.3.  SignerInfo Content

   When using FN-DSA, the fields of a SignerInfo are used as follows:

      |  TODO: Include text on security strength.

   digestAlgorithm:  Per Section 5.3 of [RFC5652], the digestAlgorithm
      field identifies the message digest algorithm used by the signer,
      and any associated parameters.  Each FN-DSA parameter set ...

   : Table 1 shows appropriate SHA-2 and SHA-3 digest

   algorithms for each parameter set.  SHA-512 [FIPS180] MUST be
      supported for use with the variants of FN-DSA in this document.
      SHA-512 is suitable for all FN-DSA parameter sets and provides an
      interoperable option for legacy CMS implementations that wish to
      migrate to use post-quantum cryptography, but that may not support
      use of SHA-3 derivatives at the CMS layer.  However, other hash
      functions MAY also be supported; in particular, SHAKE256 SHOULD be
      supported, as this is the digest algorithm used internally in FN-
      DSA.  When SHA-512 is used, the id-sha512 [RFC5754] digest
      algorithm identifier is used and the parameters field MUST be
      omitted.  When SHAKE256 is used, the id-shake256 [RFC8702] digest
      algorithm identifier is used and the parameters field MUST be
      omitted.  SHAKE256 produces 512 bits of output when used as a
      message digest algorithm in the CMS.

      When signing using FN-DSA without including signed attributes, the
      algorithm specified in the digestAlgorithm field has no meaning,
      as FN-DSA computes signatures over entire messages rather than
      externally computed digests.  As such, the considerations above
      and in Table 1 do not apply.  Nonetheless, in this case
      implementations MUST specify SHA-512 as the digestAlgorithm in
      order to minimise the likelihood of an interoperability failure.
      When processing a SignerInfo signed using FN-DSA, if no signed
      attributes are present, implementations MUST ignore the content of
      the digestAlgorithm field.

                                for FN-DSA

      |  TODO: Verify paragraph references.

   signature:  The signature field contains the signature value
      resulting from the use of the FN-DSA signature algorithm
      identified by the signatureAlgorithm field.  The FN-DSA (pure
      mode) signature-generation operation is specified in Section X.X
      of [FIPS206], and the signature-verification operation is
      specified in Section X.X of [FIPS206].  Note that Section 5.6 of
      [RFC5652] places further requirements on the successful
      verification of a signature.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC5652] and I-D.turner-lamps-fn-dsa-
   certificates apply to this specification.

   Security of the FN-DSA private key is critical.  Compromise of the
   private key will enable an adversary to forge arbitrary signatures.

      |  TODO: Verify paragraph reference.

   FN-DSA depends on high quality random numbers that are suitable for
   use in cryptography.  The use of inadequate pseudo-random number
   generators (PRNGs) to generate such values can significantly
   undermine the security properties offered by a cryptographic
   algorithm.  For instance, an attacker may find it much easier to
   reproduce the PRNG environment that produced any private keys,
   searching the resulting small set of possibilities, rather than
   brute-force searching the whole key space.  The generation of random
   numbers of a sufficient level of quality for use in cryptography is
   difficult; see Section X.X.X of [FIPS206] for some additional
   information.

      |  TODO: Insert references for active research.

   By default, FN-DSA signature generation uses randomness from two
   sources: fresh random data generated during signature generation, and
   precomputed random data included in the signer's private key.  This
   is referred to as the "hedged" variant of FN-DSA.  Inclusion of both
   sources of random data can help mitigate against faulty random number
   generators, side-channel attacks, and fault attacks.  [FIPS206] also
   permits creating deterministic signatures using just the precomputed
   random data in the signer's private key.  The same verification
   algorithm is used to verify both hedged and deterministic signatures,
   so this choice does not affect interoperability.  The signer SHOULD
   NOT use the deterministic variant of FN-DSA on platforms where side-
   channel attacks or fault attacks are a concern.  Side channel attacks
   and fault attacks against FN-DSA are an active area of research XX
   XX.  Future protection against these styles of attack may involve
   interoperable changes to the implementation of FN-DSA's internal
   functions.  Implementers SHOULD consider implementing such protection
   measures if it would be beneficial for their particular use cases.

   To avoid algorithm substitution attacks, the CMSAlgorithmProtection
   attribute defined in [RFC6211] SHOULD be included in signed
   attributes.

5.  Operational Considerations

   If FN-DSA signing is implemented in a hardware device such as a
   hardware security module (HSM) or a portable cryptographic token,
   implementers might want to avoid sending the full content to the
   device for performance reasons.  By including signed attributes,
   which necessarily includes the message-digest attribute and the
   content-type attribute as described in Section 5.3 of [RFC5652], the
   much smaller set of signed attributes are sent to the device for
   signing.

6.  IANA Considerations

   For the ASN.1 module in Appendix A, IANA [ is requested/has assigned
   ] the following object identifier (OID) in the "SMI Security for S/
   MIME Module Identifier" registry (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.0):
